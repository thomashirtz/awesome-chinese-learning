## Flashcards

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the default app for flashcards on android and windows.

### Decks
Here are some decks worth noting:
*  ["Best Anki Deck for HSK I've come across"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/7mjmjc/best_anki_deck_for_hsk_ive_come_across/): The deck that I use extensively. It is extremely good and accompanied me throughout my entire learning journey.
* [Chinese Radicals](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/842457706): Very good to have a grasp of all the radicals in order to understand better the Chinese characters.
* [Chinese Grammar Study Set](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/782551504): Not a huge fan of it. I didn't use it much; however, I can understand why people can like it.
* Your own deck! The best way to learn vocabulary is to learn words that you actually see in your life. I generally create them from my Zhongwen word list.

Many others are available on the [Anki website](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/chinese) and online more generally

### Settings  
Training vocabulary with flashcards will take quite some time. It is, therefore, _strongly_ recommended to finely tune the settings of the deck before using it extensively. Suggestions of guides:
* [Guide to Anki Intervals and Learning Steps](https://youtu.be/1XaJjbCSXT0)
* [Other guides](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=anki+guide)

<details>
 
<summary>Here is my deck setting (it is tailored made and should be tuned at your liking)</summary>
 
```
 # Daily Limits
 New cards/day = 5
 Maximum reviews/day = 100
 
 # New Cards
 Learning steps = 1m 10m 1d 6d
 Graduating interval = 7
 Easy interval = 10
 Insertion order = Random
 
 # Lapses
 Relearning steps = 10m 20m
 Minimum interval = 2
 Leech threshold = 5
 Leech action = Tag Only
 
 # Advanced

 Starting ease = 2.50
 Easy bonus = 1.30
 Interval modifier = 1.10
 Hard interval = 1.20
 New interval = 0.80
```
 
</details>

### Add-ons

Here is the list of useful Anki add-ons:
* [Auto Ease Factor](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1672712021) or [Reset Ease](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/947935257): Extensions made in order to avoid the [Ease Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roR8S9zjUh8).
* [Review Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083): Extension to help you visualize past and future review activity.

Other add-ons can be found on [this](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1) page.

## [Zhongwen](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen) (Browser extension)
Zhongwen is a Chinese pop-up dictionary for browsers (Chrome, Firefox, ...). It is useful to get the translation of specific words on a page by hovering over the word with the mouse.

It is also possible to add the hovered vocabulary to a list by pressing "R". The list can be accessed using "Alt + W".

### Anki
The vocabulary list can be downloaded and added to ANKI.

### Awfice
If you have some text that you want to analyze using the browser extension zhongwen, you can paste it into [awfice](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zserge/awfice/blob/main/edit.html).

### Netflix
It is possible to make the dynamic lookup of subtitles work directly in the browser (at least in Mozilla). Two extensions are needed, as well as a little hack:
1. Install [Zhongwen](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen)
2. Install [Subfilter](https://github.com/met/subfilter)
3. Go to the show or movie you want to watch, and change the language from the extension Subfilter to _Simplified Chinese_. (Obviously, the media do need to have Chinese subtitles available.)
4. Press F11 to put it full screen (Zhongwen does not work full screen on Netflix).

### Pop-up dictionary on documents 
One of the main tricks I used while studying in China. You can convert many different formats into PDFs (by printing them). You can then convert them into HTML and use them in the browser to have a pop-up dictionary with zhongwen.

Note: You might have to give Zhongwen permission to access files on your local file system, at least on Chrome.

### Novels in HTML
Some Chinese novels are available for free online in an HTML format. It is perfect for our new favorite trick, the pop-up dictionary.

Example of a free book : [三体](https://www.shizongzui.cc/santi/),

## Video Resources
[Douban](https://movie.douban.com/tv/#!type=tv&tag=%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%A7%E5%89%A7&sort=recommend&page_limit=20&page_start=0) is the main website to watch the score of different movies/TV shows. It is the equivalent of IMDB.  
If you want to search for very specific TV shows, you can take a look at the tool I wrote : [douban-crawler](https://github.com/thomashirtz/douban-crawler)

Youku, iQIYI and MangoTV are kind of Netflix style. In general there is always one or two great TV shows on them that are exclusive and makes you want to subscribe. The Subscription is very very cheap as far as I remember. However the selection of "good" TV shows is quite limited. It can be nice to subscribe just some months to watch them.

### [Bilibili (哔哩哔哩)](https://www.bilibili.com/)
The equivalent of youtube in China. However, in contrast to Youtube, Netflix, ..., the platform does not have built-in subtitles. It is, therefore, less convenient to learn Chinese with this platform.

### [Youku (优酷)](https://www.youku.com/)

### [iQIYI (爱奇艺)](https://www.iqiyi.com/)

### [MangoTV (芒果TV)](https://w.mgtv.com/) 
I liked this one because when I start watching Chinese TV Shows, it has 爸爸去哪儿. This show is great for beginner.

### [XuetangX (学堂在线)](https://www.xuetangx.com/)
The equivalent of Coursera in Chinese, you can use the Zhongwen + F11 Mode in order to have the possibility of a dictionary pop-up when watching classes.

### [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse)
Netflix can be used to learn Chinese! Thanks to the hack explained [here](https://github.com/thomashirtz/chinese-learning#netflix).

### [Chinese Zero To Hero](https://chinesezerotohero.teachable.com/courses) 
The platform contains many Chinese courses. It is not free; however, it works as a one-time purchase. Very clean and exceptionally well made. The classes are based on the books from BLCU.

### [Viki](https://www.viki.com/)
Shows and movies with a built-in lookup of the Chinese subtitles are available. It is extremely well made; however, the selection of shows having the feature was quite poor several years ago.

## Text Resources

### [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/hot)
Website similar to Quora, where all the new trends are discussed, questions are asked, ... It seems a great way to know the latest trends.

### [Toutiao](https://www.toutiao.com)
Most popular news aggregator in China. That can be nice to hear the latest events in China. 

### [Weibo](https://weibo.com)
The chinese twitter. Also a great way to discover the current trends. However, in contrary to Zhihu, you need to know some accounts to follow, and it can be daunting to find nice feeds in the beginning, especially without a deep Chinese understanding. I therefore never really hooked up to that platform.

## Audio Resources

### AudioBooks and Podcasts

#### [Ximalaya (喜马拉雅)](https://www.ximalaya.com/)
A lot of free ebooks, podcast and else. It is one of the most popular application of this genre. I mainly used this one in the past.

#### [Lanren Tingshu (懒人听书)](https://www.lrts.me/)
#### [QQ Dushu (QQ读书)](https://book.qq.com/)
#### [Weixin Dushu (微信读书)](https://weread.qq.com/)

Most of the books present in the websites/applications (even behind paywalls) that has just been listed are not accessible outside of China. I tried to subscribe to most of them and couldn't have access to the popular book from France (I did try using the VPN of my school to pretend that I was in China and it didn't work either).

### Music

The two following platforms are great to listen to Chinese songs and songs in general. The subscription is quite inexpensive in comparison to services such as Deezer or Spotify.

#### [NetEase Cloud Music (网易云音乐)](https://www.ximalaya.com/)
#### [QQ Music (QQ音乐)](https://music.qq.com/)

## Calligraphy & Writing

### [Shufazidian (书法字典)](http://shufazidian.com/)  
Shufazidian is a website as well as a mini program that display the character selected in different style of writing. It is extremely helpful when learning to do some calligraphy.

### [How to write Chinese character](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ansami.hkchinesechar&hl=en_US&gl=US) (Android application)  
It is an excellent android application for learning how to write characters as well as stroke orders.

### [Animated stroke order for Chinese characters](https://www.chineseconverter.com/en/convert/chinese-stroke-order-tool) (In Browser)
A website that can show the stroke orders of the inputed characters.

## Dictionaries
Two primary chinese-english dictionaries are popular. Both have a free version, and a version where you have a one-time purchase to get more vocabulary (definitely worth it). Some comparisons exist on the internet. I am more a hanping user, I prefer the ergonomy of it. However, I do know that in general people prefer Pleco.

###  [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/)

###  [Hanping](https://hanpingchinese.com/)

## Translators

### [Google translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN)

The best translator, not available in China.

### [Bing translator](https://www.bing.com/translator)

Works in China.

### [Baidu translator](https://fanyi.baidu.com)


## Multimedia players

### [PotPlayer](https://potplayer.daum.net/)
Potplayer is a really powerful multimedia player. If you own some videos with Chinese subtitles, you can dynamically search online the words that you clicked on.  
This can be set in :
```
Preferences => Subtitles => Research by word 
```
You need to put `%%SS` where the word from the subtitle will be in the URL query. I generally redirect the query to MDBG:
```
https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=%%SS
```

### [Podcast addict](https://www.podcastaddict.com/)

Excellent smartphone application to listen to audiobook files. You can easily load files from your local storage, do +/- 20 seconds, and set sleep timers.

## Miscellaneous

### [chinese-shadowing](https://github.com/thomashirtz/chinese-shadowing)
It is a small tool I wrote in order to do some shadowing using the deck mentioned in the Flashcards section. 

### Chinese OCR
Here are some Chinese OCRs for converting an image to text using the computer (It can be pretty helpful if you want, for example, put the Chinese textbook's vocabulary list into your Anki deck).
1. [Convertio](https://convertio.co/ocr/chinese/)
2. [Easy ScreenOCR](https://online.easyscreenocr.com/Home/ChineseOCR)

### Pinyin Converter
It is a converter that transforms Chinese characters into pinyin. Such can be very useful, especially when creating Anki cards or else.
1. [Lexilogos](https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/pinyin_conversion.htm)
2. [ChineseConverter](https://www.chineseconverter.com/en/convert/chinese-to-pinyin) (Seems to have many different nice tools, including conversion traditional<=>chinese)

### Chinese pinyin input with non-QWERTY keyboards 

[Stack overflow thread](https://superuser.com/questions/112847/chinese-ime-input-method-in-azerty-on-windows-google-ime) regarding this issue.
